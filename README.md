# This project has been abandoned
# You can join the [discord](https://dcd.gg/ogfnprojecthub) anyway but the website and database will no longer be updated, so expect a lot of errors

[Project Hub](https://projecthub.jgc.linkpc.net/) is a website and Discord server which helps you find the best OG Fortnite resources.

### Why is this a repo?
Although the website is currently hosted on Google Sites, I need a GitHub repository to make it visible on my [web](http://jgc.linkpc.net/) and to use some  advanced features. **This will soon be a working API**.
