## This project has been abandoned
You have the website in [/docs](docs) and part of the database in [/data](data/projects.json).
You can join the [discord](https://dcd.gg/ogfnprojecthub) anyway but the website and database will no longer be updated, so expect a lot of errors

[Project Hub](https://projecthub.jgc.linkpc.net/) was a website and is a Discord server which helps you find the best OG Fortnite resources.

### Why is this a repository?
This was going to be a working API.
